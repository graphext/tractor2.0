# Development

First, install [bun](https://bun.sh) on your machine. You only need to do this once.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```


Then, clone the repository, as usual:

```shell
gh repo clone graphext/tractor2.0
```


Go to the `tractor2.0` directory and run `bun i` to install all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.

For development, in the `tractor2.0` directory, run `bun run dev`, which will spin up the development environment.
